Award points based on the user quiz score in LearnDash.

== Description ==

GamiPress - LearnDash Points Per Quiz Score let's you award a percent of the user quiz score in [LearnDash](https://www.learndash.com/ "LearnDash") as [GamiPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/gamipress/ "GamiPress") points.

You can configure the percent of the quiz score to award. A few examples:

* A 100% will award the same user quiz score as points (e.g. score of 40 = 40 points).
* A 200% will award the double of the user quiz score as points (e.g. score of 40 = 80 points).
* A 50% will award the half of the user quiz score as points (e.g. score of 40 = 20 points).

Also, you can enable and configure it per points type so you will be able to award a 100% of the quiz score for a specific points type and a 200% for another points type.

In addition, the add-on includes settings to only reward the points when passing the quiz and to reward only the first time (on first attempt or first time passed).
